#### A basic code generator using GPT2, fine-tuned from the pytorch [pre-trained GPT-2 variants](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html)
- This work was done as a part of 4 month Research Internship in my college lab.
- We have fine-tuned the language model and achieved an accuracy of 49%.
- Future work includes developing a production ready model and integrate it with IDE's.
